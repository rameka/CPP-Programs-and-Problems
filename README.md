## CPP Programs(Problems)
 * **Echo Server:** A socket programs in c++ illustrating the implementation of client and server of an Echo Server
 * **Producer Consumer:** It is a program in part worker and product worker producer consumer problem. The problem statem is attached to    the folder. It uses threads to solve the problem.
 * **BlockingQueue.cpp:** Own implementation of blocking queue using unique_lock in threads.
 * **DoubleLinkedListOperations.cpp:** This program implements functionalities in DLL like sorting(selection sort), reversing, traversal,          printing.
 * **LinkedListSort.cpp:** This program implements the insertion sort in singly linked list
 * **Polynomial Operations.cpp:** This program uses operator overloading and singly linked list to perform polynomial addition, multiplication and creation
